# Genetic Pathfinder

## Description
A C# program that demonstrates path finding based on a genetic algorithm. I wrote the program when I was in university in 2018 as an exercise while studying genetic programming. When developing this, I was highly inspired by [this](https://habr.com/ru/post/128704/) article describing the topic.
